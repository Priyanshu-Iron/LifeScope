## Project Summary

Lifescope was developed during the Galgotias University Internship Program to address the challenges of real-time patient health monitoring. It allows patients to input critical health data such as blood pressure and symptoms. The system:
- 🚨 Sends automatic alerts to physicians when abnormal health data is detected.
- 💊 Ensures timely prescription of medications, validated by pharmacists.
- 📟 Proposes future integration of wearable health-monitoring devices for continuous, automated data collection.

## Features
- 👩‍⚕️ **Patient Health Data Input**: Patients can log critical health metrics (e.g., blood pressure).
- 📩 **Automated Notifications**: Real-time alerts for physicians when patient data exceeds critical thresholds.
- 📝 **Medication Workflow**: Physicians can prescribe medications; pharmacists validate them before reaching patients.
- ⌚ **Future Wearable Device Integration**: Seamless connection with smart devices for automated health data collection.

## Technology Stack
### Frontend
- 🌐 **HTML/CSS**: For structured and styled web pages.
- ⚡ **JavaScript**: To enable dynamic interactivity.

### Backend
- 🖥️ **Node.js**: Manages server-side operations and data flow.
- 🗄️ **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing patient, physician, and pharmacist data.

### Hosting and Tools
- ☁️ **AWS**: Provides scalable and high-performance hosting.
- 🛠️ **GitHub**: For version control and collaborative development.

## Use Case Scenarios
### Scenario 1: High Blood Pressure Alert
1. 👨‍⚕️ A patient logs their blood pressure reading in the system.
2. 🚨 If the reading exceeds a critical threshold, an alert is sent to the physician.
3. 🩺 The physician reviews the data and prescribes medication.
4. 💊 The pharmacist validates the prescription before the patient receives the medication.

### Scenario 2: Wearable Device Integration
1. ⌚ A smartwatch monitors a patient’s blood pressure continuously.
2. 📡 The readings are automatically sent to the Lifescope system.
3. 🚑 The system alerts the physician if critical levels are detected.
4. 📋 The physician intervenes promptly without requiring manual input.

## Installation
1. 📥 Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/lifescope.git
   ```
2. 📂 Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd lifescope
   ```
3. 📦 Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. 🔧 Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add the required variables:
     ```env
     PORT=your_port
     DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
     ```
5. ▶️ Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Future Work
- ⌚ Integration with wearable health-monitoring devices.
- 📈 Expansion to monitor additional health parameters such as heart rate and blood glucose levels.
